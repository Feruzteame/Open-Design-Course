   On the first week of September we received an email for an interview. It was on the 3rd of September. We start the day with introduction and collaborative assignments. The collaborative assignment was about the concept of freedom by Lloyd Morrisett. We were divided into small groups and doing a peer to peer learning and created a project together. After that we were asked to present our collaborative works. The next agenda was the interview. The interview was done individually. We were invited to a separate room and asked a general question. The language used for the course is English.
   The selected participants start the course on the 9th September. Only 15 people are chosen. The course will be held for about 3 months (until November). The first day of the course was fun and insightful. It was introducing about the open design concept as a whole. We learned also about soft tools and digital tools during the course. We discussed also about copy right, peer to peer learning methods, etc. Our course is a unique kind of learning environment. The teachers were coming from many different backgrounds. The learning environment was more of a sharing knowledge and ideas. Some of the subject we learned in the course ie Sound, HTML, Arduino, Blender, Narative Practices, The Screen Printing, The Book Cover experiment, Libre object workshop. The course was design to facilitate different kind of interest from the participants. It was very inspiring to meet with people who have different interest. The organizer also provided the participants with transportation reimbursement and lunch. Besides that they also borrowed us a laptop for us to work. We had opportunities to follow workshops and or projects outside the regular course in the weekend. For example the School of Love, Visible Project, and Sophia Conference.
   At the end of the course, each participant can chose any kind of projects suited with his/her interest. The organizer gave certain amount of fund to support the projects. This project will be shown on an exhibition on the last week of November. A certificate of attendance of the course will be given at the end of the course.
