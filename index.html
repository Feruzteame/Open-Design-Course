            <p>On the first week of September we received an email for an interview. It was on the 3rd of September. We start the day with introduction and collaborative assignments. The collaborative assignment was about the concept of freedom by Lloyd Morrisett. We were divided into small groups and doing a peer to peer learning and created a project together. After that we were asked to present our collaborative works. The next agenda was the interview. The interview was done individually. We were invited to a separate room and asked a general question. The language used for the course is English.The selected participants start the course on the 9th September. Only 15 people are chosen. The course will be held for about 3 months (until November). The first day of the course was fun and insightful. It was introducing about the open design concept as a whole. We learned also about soft tools and digital tools during the course. We discussed also about copy right, peer to peer learning methods, etc. Our course is a unique kind of learning environment. The teachers were coming from many different backgrounds. The learning environment was more of a sharing knowledge and ideas. Some of the subject we learned in the course ie Sound, HTML, Arduino, Blender, Narative Practices, The Screen Printing, The Book Cover experiment, Libre object workshop. The course was design to facilitate different kind of interest from the participants. It was very inspiring to meet with people who have different interest. The organizer also provided the participants with transportation reimbursement and lunch. Besides that they also borrowed us a laptop for us to work. We had opportunities to follow workshops and or projects outside the regular course in the weekend. For example the School of Love, Visible Project, and Sophia Conference. At the end of the course, each participant can chose any kind of projects suited with his/her interest. The organizer gave certain amount of fund to support the projects. This project will be shown on an exhibition on the last week of November. A certificate of attendance of the course will be given at the end of the course.</p>

      <h1>ARDUINO</h1>
      <span class="focus">facilitator: Wendy Van Weynsberghe and Hendrik Leper</span>
      <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
         It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. We look at exisiting projects and 
         we start programming Arduino itself. Hello world, led blink!<br>
        <span class="special">material we used</span> 
        <ol>
           <li>The Arduino Platform</li>
           <li>the Arduino border</li>
           <li>The Software (IDE)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Arduino is an open source physical computing platform based on a simple input/output (I/O) board 
        and a development environment that is based on Processing. Arduino can be used to develop standalone interactive objects or 
        can be connected to software on your computer, such as Processing, the internet with a.o. P5.JS with the p5.bots library, TouchDesigner, VVVV, Max, ...<br>
        Arduino is composed of two major parts: the Arduino board, which is the piece of hardware you work on when you build your objects, and the Arduino IDE, the software you
        run on your computer. In the IDE you write a sketch (a computer program with a set of instructions) that you upload to the Arduino board. This program tells the board 
        what to do.<br>
        The Arduino board is a small microcontroller or, in other words, a small
        computer chip on a circuitboard. This computer is at least a thousand times
        less powerful than your laptop, but it’s a lot cheaper and very useful to build interesting devices.
        The programs you write for your Arduino are known as sketches. They are written in C/C++.

        <p>
         Rethinking and designing school formats while reflecting on love as a pedagogical and
         political attitude is a recurrent School Of Love activity.During September – November
         2019, SOL together with Open Design Course participants,  the Post Collective and Master
         students of the program “art and design in socio-political context”, Saint Lucas, Antwerp are hosted 
         by Open Design Course and Beursschouwburg, Brussels in the context of the program <a href="https://beursschouwburg.be/en/events/school-of-love/">we love you</a>,
         and dive into the practice of imagining and designing schools that love, using tools from
         futurology and speculative design asalso the personal stories of the participants.

        <p>
           The importance of sharing stories, of telling your story; not a finished
           one but something that needs to be recreated and re-told, done and un-done,
           over and over again:as an act of resistance,  a way of building community,
           to rescue things and (re)build living memories,to process and exchange experience,
           to re-gain space for the person(al), the subject(ity),to create space again for
           listening to others, as opposed to imposing our stories and therefore our views.
           We use narrative language, to let different stories about how each one of us lives
           in this world, co-exist.

        <p>
          P2P Ethnography, as Ethnography, can be defined as a qualitative research design aimed at exploring 
          cultural phenomena. Different from Ethnography, its aim is not to produce field studies or case reports,
          but to establish continuously available, accessible, participatory, performative and collaborative processes
          which allow gaining understandings about the knowledge and the systems of meanings in the lives of
          a social group, and its interactions with other ones.

   <p>Today was feel great day to meet my new classmeet.They are very nice people even our teachers. In the afternoon of our first day, there was a question <q>Is there any problem 
      with open design course 2019 profile to write refugee and asuylem skeers?</q><br><br><span class="focus">First who is refugee?</span><br>As my openion refugee is a person who can face many challanges
     with diffrent reason.To do something in your life with many problems such as fainanical, lonely,new cultural and languages..etc, it is not easy.So with these all challenges 
     if you can do what you want or what you wish in your life, you are strong enough.Every solutions are created by problems, so a person who has more problem he/she is more
     problem solver becouse you have an exprence how to solve your problems.For me refugee means <em>who can face challenges</em> and <em>never kneeldown</em>.<br> so for me there is no problem 
     to write these things to our profile becouse <strong>I ACCEPT MY SELF AS IT IS</strong>.<br><br></p>

     <h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
     <p>This project is not aimed to change the previous website but to give an additional content about the 2019 Open design course participant by putting it into the 
      already existed website .  The content will mainly tell about what is Open Design Course using this website.  The aims of this project are:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>To explain who are the Open design course 2019 participants</li>
        <li>To explain what we learned in the course in the hope that the upcoming participant can have a clear expectations towards the course</li>
        <li i>Make a platform as a memory for the open design school 2019 participants</li>
     </ul>
      
       <p>This documentary  project  is a collaborative effort from all of the open design course 2019 participants.We would like to thank you the participants 
         for the interview and engagement during the process. </p>
